# Demonstration of the init-platform functionality 
 
# This script fragment is sourced by /etc/init.d/init-arch.sh, which 
# in turn executes the init_platform_pre_arch() and 
# init_platform_post_arch() functions. 
 
# A machine can use this feature to run any early boot scripts needed 
# by the machine.  A typical usage would be to initialize specific 
# hardware devices. 
 
# Use this function to perform any post-initializations or clean-up. 
# This function executes after the architecture initializations.
